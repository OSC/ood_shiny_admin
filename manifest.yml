  PseudoFUN is a computational tool for studying potential functions of
  pseudogenes in the context of evolution and diseases, developed by the
  Zhang Lab of Computational Genomics and Proteomics at OSU BMI.
  PseudoFUN is made of
  
  1. a comprehensive similarity network of known pseudogenes and genes,
  2. GO functional annotations of the nodes,
  3. as well a sequence query tool that allows the querying of sequences
     (e.g. novel pseudogene sequence) against the network database.
  
  The query tool (app) retrieves functional information
  of query from the similarity networks, including gene counterparts,
  GO annotations, and enriched functions of related subnetworks.
  This tool is also scalable allowing other datatypes to be overlayed to the
  similarity network when they become available.
